/*Develop a C program that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer
'n' entered by the user. The factorial of a non-negative integer 'n' is the
product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'. For example, the
factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is calculated as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.*/
