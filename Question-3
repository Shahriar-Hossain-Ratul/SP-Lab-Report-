/*Write a C program that takes an integer input 'n' and prints the Fibonacci
sequence up to the 'n'-th term. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers
where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and
1. For example, the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3,
5, 8, 13, 21, 34.*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, a = 0, b = 1, nextTerm;

    printf("Enter the number of terms: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Fibonacci sequence is : %d, %d, ", a, b);

    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        nextTerm = a + b;
        printf("%d, ", nextTerm);
        a = b;
        b = nextTerm;
    }

    return 0;
